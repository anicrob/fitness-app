[{"name":"Triceps dip","type":"strength","muscle":"triceps","equipment":"body_only","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"To get into the starting position, hold your body at arm's length with your arms nearly locked above the bars. Now, inhale and slowly lower yourself downward. Your torso should remain upright and your elbows should stay close to your body. This helps to better focus on tricep involvement. Lower yourself until there is a 90 degree angle formed between the upper arm and forearm. Then, exhale and push your torso back up using your triceps to bring your body back to the starting position. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.  Variations: If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a dip assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight. Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help. More advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates."},{"name":"Decline EZ-bar skullcrusher","type":"strength","muscle":"triceps","equipment":"e-z_curl_bar","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and slowly lay down on the bench. Using a close grip (a grip that is slightly less than shoulder width), lift the EZ bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked and elbows in. The arms should be perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position. Tip: In order to protect your rotator cuff, it is best if you have a spotter help you lift the barbell off the rack. As you breathe in and you keep the upper arms stationary, bring the bar down slowly by moving your forearms in a semicircular motion towards you until you feel the bar slightly touch your forehead. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Lift the bar back to the starting position by contracting the triceps and exhaling. Repeat until the recommended amount of repetitions is performed.  Variations: You can use a straight bar or dumbbells to perform this movement. You can also perform it on a flat bench as well."},{"name":"Dumbbell floor press","type":"powerlifting","muscle":"triceps","equipment":"dumbbell","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Lay on the floor holding dumbbells in your hands. Your knees can be bent. Begin with the weights fully extended above you. Lower the weights until your upper arm comes in contact with the floor. You can tuck your elbows to emphasize triceps size and strength, or to focus on your chest angle your arms to the side. Pause at the bottom, and then bring the weight together at the top by extending through the elbows."},{"name":"Cable V-bar push-down","type":"strength","muscle":"triceps","equipment":"cable","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Attach a V-Bar to a high pulley and grab with an overhand grip (palms facing down) at shoulder width. Standing upright with the torso straight and a very small inclination forward, bring the upper arms close to your body and perpendicular to the floor. The forearms should be pointing up towards the pulley as they hold the bar. The thumbs should be higher than the small finger. This is your starting position. Using the triceps, bring the bar down until it touches the front of your thighs and the arms are fully extended perpendicular to the floor. The upper arms should always remain stationary next to your torso and only the forearms should move. Exhale as you perform this movement. After a second hold at the contracted position, bring the V-Bar slowly up to the starting point. Breathe in as you perform this step. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: There are many variations to this movement. For instance you can use an E-Z bar attachment as well as a straight cable bar attachment for different variations of the exercise. Also, you can attach a rope to the pulley as well as using a reverse grip on the bar exercises. Just like the Triceps Pushdown but with the V-Bar attachment."},{"name":"Weighted bench dip","type":"strength","muscle":"triceps","equipment":"body_only","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"For this exercise you will need to place a bench behind your back and another one in front of you. With the benches perpendicular to your body, hold on to one bench on its edge with the hands close to your body, separated at shoulder width. Your arms should be fully extended. The legs will be extended forward on top of the other bench. Your legs should be parallel to the floor while your torso is to be perpendicular to the floor. Have your partner place the dumbbell on your lap. Note: This exercise is best performed with a partner as placing the weight on your lap can be challenging and cause injury without assistance. This will be your starting position. Slowly lower your body as you inhale by bending at the elbows until you lower yourself far enough to where there is an angle slightly smaller than 90 degrees between the upper arm and the forearm. Tip: Keep the elbows as close as possible throughout the movement. Forearms should always be pointing down. Using your triceps to bring your torso up again, lift yourself back to the starting position while exhaling. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: By placing your legs on top of another flat bench in front of you, the exercise becomes more challenging. It is best to attempt this exercise without any weights at first in order to get used to the movements required for good form. If that variation also becomes easy, then you can have a partner place plates on top of your lap. Make sure that in this case the partner ensures that the weights stay there throughout the movement."},{"name":"EZ-Bar Skullcrusher","type":"strength","muscle":"triceps","equipment":"e-z_curl_bar","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Using a close grip, lift the EZ bar and hold it with your elbows in as you lie on the bench. Your arms should be perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position. Keeping the upper arms stationary, lower the bar by allowing the elbows to flex. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Pause once the bar is directly above the forehead. Lift the bar back to the starting position by extending the elbow and exhaling. Repeat."},{"name":"Reverse Grip Triceps Pushdown","type":"strength","muscle":"triceps","equipment":"cable","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Start by setting a bar attachment (straight or e-z) on a high pulley machine. Facing the bar attachment, grab it with the palms facing up (supinated grip) at shoulder width. Lower the bar by using your lats until your arms are fully extended by your sides. Tip: Elbows should be in by your sides and your feet should be shoulder width apart from each other. This is the starting position. Slowly elevate the bar attachment up as you inhale so it is aligned with your chest. Only the forearms should move and the elbows/upper arms should be stationary by your side at all times. Then begin to lower the cable bar back down to the original staring position while exhaling and contracting the triceps hard. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variation: This exercise can also be performed with a single handle using one arm at a time. This will allow you to better isolate the triceps. With this version you can self spot yourself by placing your hand over your forearm and applying some pressure to help you perform more reps than before."},{"name":"Push-Ups - Close Triceps Position","type":"strength","muscle":"triceps","equipment":"body_only","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Lie on the floor face down and place your hands closer than shoulder width for a close hand position. Make sure that you are holding your torso up at arms' length. Lower yourself until your chest almost touches the floor as you inhale. Using your triceps and some of your pectoral muscles, press your upper body back up to the starting position and squeeze your chest. Breathe out as you perform this step. After a second pause at the contracted position, repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.  Variations:  If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, you can either bend your legs at the knees to take off resistance or perform the exercise against the wall instead of the floor. For the most advanced lifters, you can place your feet at a high surface such as a bench in order to increase the resistance.

Hold a straight bar attachment above your head with your hands about 6 inches apart with your palms facing down. Face away from the machine and kneel. Place your head and the back of your upper arms on the bench. Your elbows should be bent with the forearms pointing towards the high pulley. This will be your starting position. While keeping your upper arms close to your head at all times with the elbows in, press the bar out in a semicircular motion until the elbows are locked and your arms are parallel to the floor. Contract the triceps hard and keep this position for a second. Exhale as you perform this movement. Slowly return to the starting position as you breathe in. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variation: You can also perform this exercise with exercise bands."},{"name":"Single-arm cable triceps extension","type":"strength","muscle":"triceps","equipment":"cable","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"With your right hand, grasp a single handle attached to the high-cable pulley using a supinated (underhand; palms facing up) grip. You should be standing directly in front of the weight stack. Now pull the handle down so that your upper arm and elbow are locked in to the side of your body. Your upper arm and forearm should form an acute angle (less than 90-degrees). You can keep the other arm by the waist and you can have one leg in front of you and the other one back for better balance. This will be your starting position. As you contract the triceps, move the single handle attachment down to your side until your arm is straight. Breathe out as you perform this movement. Tip: Only the forearms should move. Your upper arms should remain stationary at all times. Squeeze the triceps and hold for a second in this contracted position. Slowly return the handle to the starting position.

[{"name":"T-Bar Row with Handle","type":"strength","muscle":"middle_back","equipment":"other","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Position a bar into a landmine or in a corner to keep it from moving. Load an appropriate weight onto your end. Stand over the bar, and position a Double D row handle around the bar next to the collar. Using your hips and legs, rise to a standing position. Assume a wide stance with your hips back and your chest up. Your arms should be extended. This will be your starting position. Pull the weight to your upper abdomen by retracting the shoulder blades and flexing the elbows. Do not jerk the weight or cheat during the movement. After a brief pause, return to the starting position."},{"name":"Reverse-grip bent-over row","type":"strength","muscle":"middle_back","equipment":"barbell","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Stand erect while holding a barbell with a supinated grip (palms facing up). Bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up. The barbell should hang directly in front of you as your arms hang perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position. While keeping the torso stationary, lift the barbell as you breathe out, keeping the elbows close to the body and not doing any force with the forearm other than holding the weights. On the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a second. Slowly lower the weight again to the starting position as you inhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution:  This exercise is not recommended for people with back problems. A Low Pulley Row is a better choice for people with back issues. Also, just like with the bent knee dead-lift, if you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.  Variations: You can perform the same exercise using a pronated (palms facing out) grip or using dumbbells."},{"name":"One-Arm Dumbbell Row","type":"strength","muscle":"middle_back","equipment":"dumbbell","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Choose a flat bench and place a dumbbell on each side of it. Place the right leg on top of the end of the bench, bend your torso forward from the waist until your upper body is parallel to the floor, and place your right hand on the other end of the bench for support. Use the left hand to pick up the dumbbell on the floor and hold the weight while keeping your lower back straight. The palm of the hand should be facing your torso. This will be your starting position. Pull the resistance straight up to the side of your chest, keeping your upper arm close to your side and keeping the torso stationary. Breathe out as you perform this step. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. Also, make sure that the force is performed with the back muscles and not the arms. Finally, the upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the dumbbell; therefore do not try to pull the dumbbell up using the forearms. Lower the resistance straight down to the starting position. Breathe in as you perform this step. Repeat the movement for the specified amount of repetitions. Switch sides and repeat again with the other arm.  Variations: One-arm rows can also be performed using a high pulley or a low pulley instead of a dumbbell."},{"name":"One-Arm Long Bar Row","type":"strength","muscle":"middle_back","equipment":"barbell","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Position a bar into a landmine or in a corner to keep it from moving. Load an appropriate weight onto your end. Stand next to the bar, and take a grip with one hand close to the collar. Using your hips and legs, rise to a standing position. Assume a bent-knee stance with your hips back and your chest up. Your arm should be extended. This will be your starting position. Pull the weight to your side by retracting the shoulder and flexing the elbow. Do not jerk the weight or cheat during the movement. After a brief pause, return to the starting position."},{"name":"T-Bar Row","type":"strength","muscle":"middle_back","equipment":"other","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Load the bar to an appropriate weight for your training. Stand astride the bar and bend at the hips to take a pronated grip on the handles. Ensure that your back remains flat, and then remove the weight from the rests, letting the bar hang at arms length. This will be your starting position. Perform the movement by flexing the elbows and retracting the shoulder blades, pulling the weight to your chest. After a brief pause at the top of the motion, return to the starting position."},{"name":"Bent Over Two-Arm Long Bar Row","type":"strength","muscle":"middle_back","equipment":"barbell","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Put weight on one of the ends of an Olympic barbell. Make sure that you either place the other end of the barbell in the corner of two walls; or put a heavy object on the ground so the barbell cannot slide backward. Bend forward until your torso is as close to parallel with the floor as you can and keep your knees slightly bent. Now grab the bar with both arms just behind the plates on the side where the weight was placed and put your other hand on your knee. This will be your starting position. Pull the bar straight up with your elbows in (to maximize back stimulation) until the plates touch your lower chest. Squeeze the back muscles as you lift the weight up and hold for a second at the top of the movement. Breathe out as you lift the weight. Tip: Use a stirrup or double handle cable attachment by hooking it under the end of the bar. Slowly lower the bar to the starting position getting a nice stretch on the lats. Tip: Do not let the plates touch the floor. To ensure the best range of motion, I recommend using small plates (25-lb ones) as opposed to larger plates (like 35-45lb ones). Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: You can perform this exercise using a low pulley or T-bar row machine."},{"name":"Alternating sit-through with crunch","type":"strength","muscle":"middle_back","equipment":"other","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Put weight on one of the ends of an Olympic barbell.

Make sure that your heels are resting comfortably against the base of the foot pedals and that the straps are secured. Select the program that you wish to use, if applicable. Sit up straight and bend forward at the hips. There are three phases of movement when using a rower. The first phase is when you come forward on the rower. Your knees are bent and against your chest. Your upper body is leaning slightly forward while still maintaining good posture.Next, push against the foot pedals and extend your legs while bringing your hands to your upper abdominal area, squeezing your shoulders back as you do so. To avoid straining your back, use primarily your leg and hip muscles. The recovery phase simply involves straightening your arms, bending the knees, and bringing your body forward again as you transition back into the first phase."},{"name":"Seated Cable Rows","type":"strength","muscle":"middle_back","equipment":"cable","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"For this exercise you will need access to a low pulley row machine with a V-bar. Note: The V-bar will enable you to have a neutral grip where the palms of your hands face each other. To get into the starting position, first sit down on the machine and place your feet on the front platform or crossbar provided making sure that your knees are slightly bent and not locked. Lean over as you keep the natural alignment of your back and grab the V-bar handles. With your arms extended pull back until your torso is at a 90-degree angle from your legs. Your back should be slightly arched and your chest should be sticking out. You should be feeling a nice stretch on your lats as you hold the bar in front of you. This is the starting position of the exercise. Keeping the torso stationary, pull the handles back towards your torso while keeping the arms close to it until you touch the abdominals. Breathe out as you perform that movement. At that point you should be squeezing your back muscles hard. Hold that contraction for a second and slowly go back to the original position while breathing in. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: Avoid swinging your torso back and forth as you can cause lower back injury by doing so. Variations: You can use a straight bar instead of a V-Bar and perform with a pronated grip (palms facing down-forward) or a supinated grip (palms facing up-reverse grip)."},{"name":"Incline dumbbell row","type":"strength","muscle":"middle_back","equipment":"dumbbell","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Using a neutral grip, lean into an incline bench.

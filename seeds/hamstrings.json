[{"name":"Barbell Deadlift","type":"strength","muscle":"hamstrings","equipment":"barbell","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Approach the bar so that it is centered over your feet. Your feet should be about hip-width apart. Bend at the hip to grip the bar at shoulder-width allowing your shoulder blades to protract. Typically, you would use an alternating grip. With your feet and your grip set, take a big breath and then lower your hips and flex the knees until your shins contact the bar. Look forward with your head. Keep your chest up and your back arched, and begin driving through the heels to move the weight upward. After the bar passes the knees aggressively pull the bar back, pulling your shoulder blades together as you drive your hips forward into the bar. Lower the bar by bending at the hips and guiding it to the floor."},{"name":"Romanian Deadlift With Dumbbells","type":"strength","muscle":"hamstrings","equipment":"dumbbell","difficulty":"beginner","instructions":"Begin in a standing position with a dumbbell in each hand. Ensure that your back is straight and stays that way for the duration of the exercise. Allow your arms to hang perpendicular to the floor, with the wrists pronated and the elbows pointed to your sides. This will be your starting position. Initiate the movement by flexing your hips, slowly pushing your butt as far back as you can. This should entail a horizontal movement of the hips, rather than a downward movement. The knees should only partially bend, and your weight should remain on your heels. Drive your butt back as far as you can, which should generate tension in your hamstrings as your hands approach knee level. Maintain an arch in your back throughout the exercise. When your hips cannot perform any further backward movement, pause, and then slowly return to the starting position by extending the hips."},{"name":"Clean Deadlift","type":"olympic_weightlifting","muscle":"hamstrings","equipment":"barbell","difficulty":"beginner","instructions":"Begin standing with a barbell close to your shins. Your feet should be directly under your hips with your feet turned out slightly. Grip the bar with a double overhand grip or hook grip, about shoulder width apart. Squat down to the bar. Your spine should be in full extension, with a back angle that places your shoulders in front of the bar and your back as vertical as possible. Begin by driving through the floor through the front of your heels. As the bar travels upward, maintain a constant back angle. Flare your knees out to the side to help keep them out of the bar's path. After the bar crosses the knees, complete the lift by driving the hips into the bar until your hips and knees are extended."},{"name":"Sumo deadlift","type":"powerlifting","muscle":"hamstrings","equipment":"barbell","difficulty":"beginner","instructions":"Begin with a bar loaded on the ground. Approach the bar so that the bar intersects the middle of the feet. The feet should be set very wide, near the collars. Bend at the hips to grip the bar. The arms should be directly below the shoulders, inside the legs, and you can use a pronated grip, a mixed grip, or hook grip. Relax the shoulders, which in effect lengthens your arms. Take a breath, and then lower your hips, looking forward with your head with your chest up. Drive through the floor, spreading your feet apart, with your weight on the back half of your feet. Extend through the hips and knees. As the bar passes through the knees, lean back and drive the hips into the bar, pulling your shoulder blades together. Return the weight to the ground by bending at the hips and controlling the weight on the way down."},{"name":"Romanian Deadlift from Deficit","type":"olympic_weightlifting","muscle":"hamstrings","equipment":"barbell","difficulty":"beginner","instructions":"Begin standing while holding a bar at armâ€™s length in front of you. You can stand on a raised platform to increase the range of motion. Begin by flexing the knees slightly, and then flex at the hip, moving your butt back as far as possible, lowering the torso as far as flexibility allows. The back should remain in absolute extension at all times, and the bar should remain in contact with the legs. If done properly, there should be heavy tension felt in the hamstrings. Reverse the motion to return to the starting position."},{"name":"Power Snatch","type":"olympic_weightlifting","muscle":"hamstrings","equipment":"barbell","difficulty":"beginner","instructions":"Begin with a loaded barbell on the floor. The bar should be close to or touching the shins, and a wide grip should be taken on the bar. The feet should be directly below the hips, with the feet turned out as needed. Lower the hips, with the chest up and the head looking forward. The shoulders should be just in front of the bar. This will be the starting position. Begin the first pull by driving through the front of the heels, raising the bar from the ground. The back angle should stay the same until the bar passes the knees. Transition into the second pull by extending through the hips knees and ankles, driving the bar up as quickly as possible. The bar should be close to the body. At peak extension, shrug the shoulders and allow the elbows to flex to the side. As you move your feet into the receiving position, a slightly wider position, pull yourself below the bar as you elevate the bar overhead. The bar should be received in a partial squat. Continue raising the bar to the overhead position, receiving the bar locked out overhead. Return to a standing position with the weight over head."},{"name":"Power Clean from Blocks","type":"olympic_weightlifting","muscle":"hamstrings","equipment":"barbell","difficulty":"beginner","instructions":"With a barbell on boxes of the desired height, take a grip just outside the legs. Lower your hips with the weight focused on the heels, back straight, head facing forward, chest up, with your shoulders just in front of the bar. This will be your starting position. Begin the first pull by driving through the heels, extending your knees. Your back angle should stay the same, and your arms should remain straight. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight. At the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended. As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, pull yourself under the bar far enough that it can be racked onto the shoulders, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position, and complete the repetition by returning the weight to the boxes."},{"name":"Natural Glute Ham Raise","type":"strength","muscle":"hamstrings","equipment":"body_only","difficulty":"beginner","instructions":"Using the leg pad of a lat pulldown machine or a preacher bench, position yourself so that your ankles are under the pads, knees on the seat, and you are facing away from the machine. You should be upright and maintaining good posture. This will be your starting position. Lower yourself under control until your knees are almost completely straight. Remaining in control, raise yourself back up to the starting position. If you are unable to complete a rep, use a band, a partner, or push off of a box to aid in completing a repetition."},{"name":"Glute ham raise-","type":"strength","muscle":"hamstrings","equipment":"none","difficulty":"beginner","instructions":"You can use a partner for this exercise or brace your feet under something stable. Begin on your knees with your upper legs and torso upright. If using a partner, they will firmly hold your feet to keep you in position. This will be your starting position. Lower yourself by extending at the knee, taking care to NOT flex the hips as you go forward. Place your hands in front of you as you reach the floor. This movement is very difficult and you may be unable to do it unaided. Use your arms to lightly push off the floor to aid your return to the starting position."},{"name":"Snatch Deadlift","type":"olympic_weightlifting","muscle":"hamstrings","equipment":"barbell","difficulty":"beginner","instructions":"The snatch deadlift strengthens the first pull of the snatch.

[{"name":"Smith machine shrug","type":"strength","muscle":"traps","equipment":"machine","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"To begin, set the bar height on the smith machine around the middle of your thighs. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, grab the bar using a pronated grip (palms facing you) shoulder width apart from each other. Lift the barbell up and fully extend your arms with your back straight. This is the starting position. While exhaling, elevate the bar by raising your shoulders until they come close to touching your ears. Hold the contraction for a second before lowering the bar back down to the starting position while inhaling. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations:  This exercise can be performed using a squat rack with a barbell. However, be careful not to select a weight that is so heavy that it causes you to break good form as you do not have the support of the smith machine for this variation. Too much weight can harm your back. You can also use dumbbells to perform this exercise."},{"name":"Leverage Shrug","type":"strength","muscle":"traps","equipment":"machine","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Load the pins to an appropriate weight. Position yourself directly between the handles. Grasp the top handles with a comfortable grip, and then lower your hips as you take a breath. Look forward with your head and keep your chest up. Drive through the floor with your heels, extending your hips and knees as you rise to a standing position. Keep your arms straight throughout the movement, finishing with your shoulders back. This will be your starting position. Raise the weight by shrugging the shoulders towards your ears, moving straight up and down. Pause at the top of the motion, and then return the weight to the starting position."},{"name":"Standing dumbbell shrug","type":"strength","muscle":"traps","equipment":"dumbbell","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Stand erect with a dumbbell on each hand (palms facing your torso), arms extended on the sides. Lift the dumbbells by elevating the shoulders as high as possible while you exhale. Hold the contraction at the top for a second. Tip: The arms should remain extended at all times. Refrain from using the biceps to help lift the dumbbells. Only the shoulders should be moving up and down. Lower the dumbbells back to the original position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: You can perform this exercise with bands, barbells or cables. You can also use a single handle and work one side at a time."},{"name":"Standing dumbbell upright row","type":"strength","muscle":"traps","equipment":"dumbbell","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Grasp a dumbbell in each hand with a pronated (palms forward) grip that is slightly less than shoulder width. The dumbbells should be resting on top of your thighs. Your arms should be extended with a slight bend at the elbows and your back should be straight. This will be your starting position. Use your side shoulders to lift the dumbbells as you exhale. The dumbbells should be close to the body as you move it up and the elbows should drive the motion. Continue to lift them until they nearly touch your chin. Tip: Your elbows should drive the motion. As you lift the dumbbells, your elbows should always be higher than your forearms. Also, keep your torso stationary and pause for a second at the top of the movement. Lower the dumbbells back down slowly to the starting position. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: Be very careful with how much weight you use in this exercise. Too much weight leads to bad form, which in turn can cause shoulder injury. I've seen this too many times so please no jerking, swinging and cheating. Also, if you suffer from shoulder problems, you may want to stay away from upright rows and substitute by some form of lateral raises. Variations: This exercise can also be performed using a straight bar attached to a low pulley and it can also be performed using an e-z bar."},{"name":"Kettlebell sumo deadlift high pull","type":"strength","muscle":"traps","equipment":"kettlebells","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Place a kettlebell on the ground between your feet.

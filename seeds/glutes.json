[{"name":"Barbell glute bridge","type":"powerlifting","muscle":"glutes","equipment":"barbell","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Begin seated on the ground with a loaded barbell over your legs. Using a fat bar or having a pad on the bar can greatly reduce the discomfort caused by this exercise. Roll the bar so that it is directly above your hips, and lay down flat on the floor. Begin the movement by driving through with your heels, extending your hips vertically through the bar. Your weight should be supported by your upper back and the heels of your feet. Extend as far as possible, then reverse the motion to return to the starting position."},{"name":"Barbell Hip Thrust","type":"powerlifting","muscle":"glutes","equipment":"barbell","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Begin seated on the ground with a bench directly behind you. Have a loaded barbell over your legs. Using a fat bar or having a pad on the bar can greatly reduce the discomfort caused by this exercise. Roll the bar so that it is directly above your hips, and lean back against the bench so that your shoulder blades are near the top of it. Begin the movement by driving through your feet, extending your hips vertically through the bar. Your weight should be supported by your shoulder blades and your feet. Extend as far as possible, then reverse the motion to return to the starting position."},{"name":"Single-leg cable hip extension","type":"strength","muscle":"glutes","equipment":"cable","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Hook a leather ankle cuff to a low cable pulley and then attach the cuff to your ankle. Face the weight stack from a distance of about two feet, grasping the steel frame for support. While keeping your knees and hips bent slightly and your abs tight, contract your glutes to slowly \"kick\" the working leg back in a semicircular arc as high as it will comfortably go as you breathe out. Tip: At full extension, squeeze your glutes for a second in order to achieve a peak contraction. Now slowly bring your working leg forward, resisting the pull of the cable until you reach the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. Switch legs and repeat the movement for the other side.  Variations: You can perform this exercise with exercise bands."},{"name":"Glute bridge","type":"strength","muscle":"glutes","equipment":"body_only","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Lie flat on the floor on your back with the hands by your side and your knees bent. Your feet should be placed around shoulder width. This will be your starting position. Pushing mainly with your heels, lift your hips off the floor while keeping your back straight. Breathe out as you perform this part of the motion and hold at the top for a second. Slowly go back to the starting position as you breathe in.  Variations: You can perform this exercise one leg at a time."},{"name":"Single-leg glute bridge","type":"strength","muscle":"glutes","equipment":"body_only","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Lay on the floor with your feet flat and knees bent. Raise one leg off of the ground, pulling the knee to your chest. This will be your starting position. Execute the movement by driving through the heel, extending your hip upward and raising your glutes off of the ground. Extend as far as possible, pause and then return to the starting position."},{"name":"Step-up with knee raise","type":"strength","muscle":"glutes","equipment":"body_only","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Stand facing a box or bench of an appropriate height with your feet together. This will be your starting position. Begin the movement by stepping up, putting your left foot on the top of the bench. Extend through the hip and knee of your front leg to stand up on the box. As you stand on the box with your left leg, flex your right knee and hip, bringing your knee as high as you can. Reverse this motion to step down off the box, and then repeat the sequence on the opposite leg."},{"name":"Kettlebell thruster","type":"strength","muscle":"glutes","equipment":"kettlebells","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Clean two kettlebells to your shoulders. Clean the kettlebells to your shoulders by extending through the legs and hips as you pull the kettlebells towards your shoulders. Rotate your wrists as you do so. This will be your starting position. Begin to squat by flexing your hips and knees, lowering your hips between your legs. Maintain an upright, straight back as you descend as low as you can. At the bottom, reverse direction and squat by extending your knees and hips, driving through your heels. As you do so, press both kettlebells overhead by extending your arms straight up, using the momentum from the squat to help drive the weights upward. As you begin the next repetition, return the weights to the shoulders."},{"name":"Kneeling Squat","type":"powerlifting","muscle":"glutes","equipment":"barbell","difficulty":"beginner","instructions":"Set the bar to the proper height in a power rack. Kneel behind the bar; it may be beneficial to put a mat down to pad your knees. Slide under the bar, racking it across the back of your shoulders. Your shoulder blades should be retracted and the bar tight across your back. Unrack the weight. With your head looking forward, sit back with your butt until you touch your calves. Reverse the motion, returning the torso to an upright position."},{"name":"Flutter Kicks","type":"strength","muscle":"glutes","equipment":"None","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"On a flat bench lie facedown with the hips on the edge of the bench, the legs straight with toes high off the floor and with the arms on top of the bench holding on to the front edge. Squeeze your glutes and hamstrings and straighten the legs until they are level with the hips. This will be your starting position. Start the movement by lifting the left leg higher than the right leg. Then lower the left leg as you lift the right leg. Continue alternating in this manner (as though you are doing a flutter kick in water) until you have done the recommended amount of repetitions for each leg. Make sure that you keep a controlled movement at all times. Tip: You will breathe normally as you perform this movement.  Variations: As you get more advanced you can use ankle weights."},{"name":"Glute Kickback","type":"strength","muscle":"glutes","equipment":"body_only","difficulty":"beginner","instructions":"Kneel on the floor or an exercise mat and bend at the waist with your arms extended in front of you (perpendicular to the torso) in order to get into a kneeling push-up position but with the arms spaced at shoulder width. Your head should be looking forward and the bend of the knees should create a 90-degree angle between the hamstrings and the calves. This will be your starting position. As you exhale, lift up your right leg until the hamstrings are in line with the back while maintaining the 90-degree angle bend. Contract the glutes throughout this movement and hold the contraction at the top for a second. Tip: At the end of the movement the upper leg should be parallel to the floor while the calf should be perpendicular to it. Go back to the initial position as you inhale and now repeat with the left leg. Continue to alternate legs until all of the recommended repetitions have been performed.  Variations: For this exercise you can also perform all of the repetitions with one leg first and then the other one. Additionally, you can also add ankle weights."}]

[{"name":"Smith Machine Calf Raise","type":"strength","muscle":"calves","equipment":"machine","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Place a block or weight plate below the bar on the Smith machine. Set the bar to a position that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step onto the plates with the balls of your feet and place the bar on the back of your shoulders. Take the bar with both hands facing forward. Rotate the bar to unrack it. This will be your starting position. Raise your heels as high as possible by pushing off of the balls of your feet, flexing your calf at the top of the contraction. Your knees should remain extended. Hold the contracted position for a second before you start to go back down. Return slowly to the starting position as you breathe in while lowering your heels. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."},{"name":"Standing Calf Raises","type":"strength","muscle":"calves","equipment":"machine","difficulty":"beginner","instructions":"Adjust the padded lever of the calf raise machine to fit your height. Place your shoulders under the pads provided and position your toes facing forward (or using any of the two other positions described at the beginning of the chapter). The balls of your feet should be secured on top of the calf block with the heels extending off it. Push the lever up by extending your hips and knees until your torso is standing erect. The knees should be kept with a slight bend; never locked. Toes should be facing forward, outwards or inwards as described at the beginning of the chapter. This will be your starting position. Raise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down. Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: If you suffer from lower back problems, a better exercise is the calf press as during a standing calf raise the back has to support the weight being lifted. Also, maintain your back straight and stationary at all times. Rounding of the back can cause lower back injury. Variations: There are several other ways to perform a standing calf raise. A barbell instead of a machine can be used instead as well as dumbbells, one leg or two legs at a time. Refer to the exercise descriptions of these movements below. A smith machine can be used for calf raises as well."},{"name":"Seated Calf Raise","type":"strength","muscle":"calves","equipment":"machine","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Sit on the machine and place your toes on the lower portion of the platform provided with the heels extending off. Choose the toe positioning of your choice (forward, in, or out) as per the beginning of this chapter. Place your lower thighs under the lever pad, which will need to be adjusted according to the height of your thighs. Now place your hands on top of the lever pad in order to prevent it from slipping forward. Lift the lever slightly by pushing your heels up and release the safety bar. This will be your starting position. Slowly lower your heels by bending at the ankles until the calves are fully stretched. Inhale as you perform this movement. Raise the heels by extending the ankles as high as possible as you contract the calves and breathe out. Hold the top contraction for a second. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."},{"name":"Calf Press On The Leg Press Machine","type":"strength","muscle":"calves","equipment":"machine","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"Using a leg press machine, sit down on the machine and place your legs on the platform directly in front of you at a medium (shoulder width) foot stance. Lower the safety bars holding the weighted platform in place and press the platform all the way up until your legs are fully extended in front of you without locking your knees. (Note: In some leg press units you can leave the safety bars on for increased safety. If your leg press unit allows for this, then this is the preferred method of performing the exercise.) Your torso and the legs should make perfect 90-degree angle. Now carefully place your toes and balls of your feet on the lower portion of the platform with the heels extending off. Toes should be facing forward, outwards or inwards as described at the beginning of the chapter. This will be your starting position. Press on the platform by raising your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down. Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: Be very cautious as you place the feet in the bottom part of the platform as if you slip and the safety bars are not locked then you could suffer a serious accident. Variations: You can perform this exercise one leg at a time."},{"name":"Rocking Standing Calf Raise","type":"strength","muscle":"calves","equipment":"barbell","difficulty":"beginner","instructions":"This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place it on the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck). Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance. Also maintain a straight back and keep the knees with a slight bend; never locked. This will be your starting position. Raise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending (other than the slight initial bend we created during positioning) at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down. Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched. Now lift your toes by contracting the tibia muscles in the front of the calves as you breathe out. Hold for a second and bring them back down as you breathe in. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: Maintain your back straight and stationary at all times. Rounding of the back can cause lower back injury. Also, choose a conservative weight. This exercise requires a lot of balance and choosing too much weight may cause you to lose balance and fall. Variations: A smith machine can be used for this exercise as well and it is a better choice for those with poor balance. Dumbbells can be used also."},{"name":"Calf Press","type":"strength","muscle":"calves","equipment":"machine","difficulty":"beginner","instructions":"Adjust the seat so that your legs are only slightly bent in the start position. The balls of your feet should be firmly on the platform. Select an appropriate weight, and grasp the handles. This will be your starting position. Straighten the legs by extending the knees, just barely lifting the weight from the stack. Your ankle should be fully flexed, toes pointing up. Execute the movement by pressing downward through the balls of your feet as far as possible. After a brief pause, reverse the motion and repeat."},{"name":"Standing barbell calf raise","type":"strength","muscle":"calves","equipment":"barbell","difficulty":"beginner","instructions":"This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes.

A calf press machine instead of a squat rack can be used as well as dumbbells with one leg or two legs at a time. A smith machine can be used for calf raises as well. You can also perform the barbell calf raise using a piece of wood to place the ball of the foot. This will allow you to get a better range of motion. However be cautious as in this case you will need to balance yourself much better."},{"name":"Barbell Seated Calf Raise","type":"strength","muscle":"calves","equipment":"barbell","difficulty":"beginner","instructions":"Place a block about 12 inches in front of a flat bench. Sit on the bench and place the ball of your feet on the block. Have someone place a barbell over your upper thighs about 3 inches above your knees and hold it there. This will be your starting position. Raise up on your toes as high as possible as you squeeze the calves and as you breathe out. After a second contraction, slowly go back to the starting position. Tip: To get maximum benefit stretch your calves as far as you can. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: You can use the smith machine or the seated calf raise machine in order to perform this exercise. Alternatively, you can also use dumbbells by placing one on top of each thigh."},{"name":"Balance Board","type":"strength","muscle":"calves","equipment":"other","difficulty":"beginner","instructions":"Note: This exercise is designed to increase balance.  Place a balance board in front of you. Stand up on it and try to balance yourself. Hold the balance for as long as desired.  Caution: If your balance is poor, start out with one of the less challenging boards. Variations: You can perform this exercise using various types of balance boards. Some are more challenging than others."},{"name":"Weighted donkey calf raise","type":"strength","muscle":"calves","equipment":"other","difficulty":"intermediate","instructions":"For this exercise you will need access to a donkey calf raise machine. Start by positioning your lower back and hips under the padded lever provided. The tailbone area should be the one making contact with the pad. Place both of your arms on the side handles and place the balls of your feet on the calf block with the heels extending off. Align the toes forward, inward or outward, depending on the area you wish to target, and straighten the knees without locking them. This will be your starting position. Raise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down. Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: If you don't have a machine available but have access to a calf block and a sturdy object to hold on to, you can perform this using as resistance a person sitting on your lower back (around the tailbone area)."}]
